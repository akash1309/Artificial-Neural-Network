# Artificial-Neural-Network
Artificial Neural Network from basic to advanced using PyTorch.

Requirements:

1) Python 3.7 
2) PyTorch
3) Numpy
4) Pandas
5) Matplotlib
6) GPU (if available)

If you do not want to install all these libraries or you dont have enough space in your computer, then my advise to you is to use Google Colab. It is an online platform provided by google for ML or AI learners with everything pre installed.
